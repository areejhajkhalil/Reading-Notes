# css :
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, this programming language dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear on the frontend of the page.

1-*The background-color property sets the background color of an element, the background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).*

2-*Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to read.*

 -body {background-color: #92a8d1;}

3-*Simply add the appropriate CSS selector and define the color property with the value you want. For example, say you want to change the color of all paragraphs on your site to navy. Then you'd add p {color: #000080; } to the head section of your HTML file.*

4-*hree Ways to Insert CSS:
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

-External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

-Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

-internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page. An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.
