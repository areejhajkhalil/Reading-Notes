5- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

* HTML5 Layout
1- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
2-The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
3- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
4- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.
