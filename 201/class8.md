**Loyout:**
-*There are five types:*

**static:**
*HTML elements are positioned static by default and the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document; static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.*


**relative:**
*The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document is positioned relative to its normal position, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.*

**absolute:**:
*The element is removed from the normal document flow, and, in the page layout, no space is created for the element. The element is positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor, if there is any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block and its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.*

**fixed:**
*The element it is removed from the normal document flow, and, in the page layout, there is no space created for the element. The element is positioned relative to its initial containing block established by the viewport and its final position is determined by the values top, right, bottom, and left.*

**sticky:**
*The element is positioned corresponding to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its closest ascending block-level, including table-related elements, according to the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.*

*-<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.*

*-Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.*

*-The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)*

*-Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.*

*-Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate
 its relevance without scrolling).*

*-Grids help create professional and flexible designs.*

*-CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.*

*-You can include multiple CSS files in one page.*
